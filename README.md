# Front End Styleguide Brand Guidelines

## Mark and Logo

Both mark and logo are set in [Maven Pro Medium](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Maven+Pro). If possible the main brand color should be used, otherwise pure white or a shade of gray. Black almost never looks good, but if it serves your purpose go for it.

## Colors

```css
:root {
  --brand-hex: #1d5097;
  --brand-rgb: rgb(29, 80, 151);
}
```

<div style="width:100px;height:100px;background:#1d5097;border-radius:20%"></div>
